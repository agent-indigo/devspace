# DevSpace

## Description

This is the DevSpace blog project from Brad Traversy's 2021 Next.js from Development to Deployment: Build a Music Event Website course on O'Reilly.

I made the following modifications:

- Implemented pagination in the blog categories

- Moved repeated heading and pagination code into a component and a utility respectively

- Folded the HTML contents of the Header component into the Layout component because it wasn't used anywhere else
